## Jordan Dick

'm' to switch between perspective and first person modes

Perspective
    Arrow keys to rotate the scene
First Person
    WASD to move forward/backward & strafe, Arrow Keys to look up/down and rotate left/right

esc or q to quit


Interesting note about normals:
   for any regular polyhedron or similar that has faces with a line that passes through the origin and the centroid of the face and is orthogonal to the face, the normal for the surface (assuming it is to be rendered flat) can be calculated as the sum of the vector locations of the vertices. Enabling GL_NORMALIZE removes the necessity of dividing the resulting vector down to unit length.
   This made calculating the normals for the dodecahedron and icosahedron a simple matter of vector addition rather than the mess of inverse trigonometry it would have been otherwise
