## HW4

### OpenGL 3 & 4
attempt to migrate the previous homework to a newer OpenGL version

### Controls

to run the program use
```
./hw3
```
  
  
* arrow keys: rotate the camera
* z/x - zoom in and out
* space bar - pause animation
* ,/. - slow down/speed up animation
* n - toggle perspective/ortho projection modes

### Results
This program does not run yet. It will compile, but will only display a black screen. glGetError returns the ever helpful and incredibly specific error code for "invalid operation".
