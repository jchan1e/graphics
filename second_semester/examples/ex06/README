Demonstrates the use of OpenGL 4 style shaders
Mixes fixed and programmable pipelines
Uses OpenGL to determine matrices
Hint:  If you cannot get this program to compile on your machine because
OpenGL 4.3 is not supported, try changing all the 4.3 references to 3.3 in
the shaders as well as when starting GLEW
