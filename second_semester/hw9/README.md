# HW8: Using Textures for Data Storage

### Build
Requirements  
* C++11
* SDL2
* Nvidia toolkit (I used 7.5)
* make

```
make
```

### Controls
* esc - quit
* z/x - zoom
* arrow keys - rotate around the field
* 0 - reset view angles

### Fun Facts
This is supposed to create a randomly dispersed field of particles that evaluate an n-body gravitational simulation using cuda, and then respawn in a random stationary position after a minute or so. The particles aren't rendering and I'm not sure why
